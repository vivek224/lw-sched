# Description 


The code of this loop scheduling library contains the key idea for the within-node solution proposed and studied in my dissertation. 

For the general solution for MPI+OpenMP application programs, you need to link the vsched library with files from a library that predicts MPI communication time for an upcoming collective call or MPI_Isend/ MPI_Irecv / MPI_Waitall during execution of an application program.
The library is in the repository on my github page named 'slack-trace'.

# Notes for Installing and Using the Library 
- Note that the compilerTuning should be part of the uSchedTransform

# TODO:

- Add more information about installing and using the library
